# React + Vite

This repository is a collection of examples where I explored and worked individually with all major React Hooks. Each hook is demonstrated with a small use case to understand its purpose and usage.

# ðŸ“¦ Features

useState â€“ Manage component state

# ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- useEffect â€“ Handle side effects (fetching data, subscriptions, timers)
- useRef â€“ Access and store DOM elements or mutable values



### useMemo â€“ Optimize performance with memoized values

### useCallback â€“ Memoize functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Custom Hooks â€“ Reusable logic across multiple components
